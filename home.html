                    <p class = "tm-text-normal">The interface of washing machine is showing on the top of the machine. There are three main components. One is use to power on or off the machine, working as the main controller of the washing machine. There is another button that is used to start or end the washing program. It could also pause the program if there is accident happening. The largest spin button on the interface is used to change the mode of washing depending on users' needs. </p>

	            		<li>Since Gemma and Alvin only use one mode when they are interacting with the interface of washing machine, they think all other functions on the interface could be simplified. However, M, as a housewife, changes the mode frequently based on the material of her clothes. </li>
